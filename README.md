These practice session are split into three sections. 
  - One contains the steps to getting started on ROSA ("Getting started with ROSA"). 
  - Another is about deploying an application to ROSA to get better familiar with the internals of OpenShift ("Deploy the application"). 
  - While the last is a summary of a few key OpenShift concepts that will be used in the workshop.
