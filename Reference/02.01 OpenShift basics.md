**Exercise 1**

In this exercise, learn how to access the OpenShift web console and command-line interfaces (CLI).

**Note: the sample output shown in the lab guide may be slightly different than what you see in the output when you issue the commands for your cluster.**

**Set up CLI access for the cluster**

Red Hat OpenShift utilizes the **oc** command to extend the capabilities of the **kubectl** command. The **kubectl** command is provided as well to support existing workflows and scripts.  You can learn more about the **oc** and **kubectl** differences <a href=https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/cli_reference/differences_oc_kubectl.html target="_blank">here</a>.


**Access the OpenShift web console**

To begin, launch the OpenShift web console from the IBM Cloud portal.  

- Access your OpenShift lab cluster from the IBM Cloud portal: <a <a href="##OPENSHIFT.overviewUrl##" target="_blank">##OPENSHIFT.overviewUrl##</a>.

- Open the **OpenShift web console**. 

**Note: the IBM Cloud Portal and  OpenShift web console will be opened in a new browser tabs.  You will need to switch between this tab and the new tabs to accomplish many of the lab tasks.  You may want to open the new tabs in new windows and display both browser windows at the same time. You may need to disable up blockers if you do not see the new tabs.**

- Once in the console, select your lab ID in the upper right, click. Scroll down and click **Copy Login Command**.

**Access your cluster using OpenShift command line interface**

- **Paste the login command** you copied from the Web UI into the lab terminal window. You can paste it using the right mouse and select paste from the menu or the paste keyboard shortcut for your operating system. The command will look similar to this:

```
oc login ##OPENSHIFT.dashboardUrl## --token=r0Nco6NU5Le3g......
```

You should see a success message similar to this:

```
Logged into "##OPENSHIFT.dashboardUrl##" as "IAM#openlabs" using the token provided.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * default
    ibm-cert-store
    ibm-system
    kube-proxy-and-dns
    kube-public
    kube-service-catalog
    kube-system
    openshift
    openshift-ansible-service-broker
    openshift-console
    openshift-infra
    openshift-monitoring
    openshift-node
    openshift-template-service-broker
    openshift-web-console

Using project "default".
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
```

Validate access to your cluster.

**Note: when you see commands in a black box with green text, you can execute these commands in the terminal window to the right several different ways:**

1. Manually type the command in the terminal window
2. Cut and paste from the instructions to the terminal window
3. Click on the green text and it will automatically be copied from the instructions window to the terminal window

- Execute the command below to view nodes in the cluster:

```execute
oc get node
```

Sample Output:

```
NAME            STATUS    ROLES           AGE       VERSION
10.95.223.250   Ready     compute,infra   9d        v1.11.0+d4cacc0
```

- Execute the command below to view services, deployments, and pods:

```execute
oc get svc,deploy,po --all-namespaces
```

Sample Output:

```
NAMESPACE                           NAME                                         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                      AGE
default                             service/docker-registry                      ClusterIP      172.21.44.207    <none>         5000/TCP                     9d

NAMESPACE                           NAME                                                       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
default                             deployment.extensions/appsody-operator                     1         1         1            1           23h
default                             deployment.extensions/docker-registry                      2         2         2            2           9d

NAMESPACE                           NAME                                                      READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
default                             pod/appsody-operator-6746fc969d-d8x4q                     1/1       Running            0          23h
default                             pod/docker-registry-7bf49f5bc4-ck4xc                      1/1       Running            0          9d
```

**Note: some commands have large amounts of data in their output. You can scroll up and down in the terminal window and clear it using the "clear" command**

- Execute the command below to clear the terminal screen

```execute
clear
```

- Execute the command below to view all OpenShift projects:

```execute
oc get projects
```

Sample Output:

```
NAME                                DISPLAY NAME   STATUS
default                                            Active
ibm-cert-store                                     Active
ibm-system                                         Active
```
